title: 3. What phase of data analysis are you in?
---
There are many types of resources, and some are better than others for the phase you’re working on in your project. Some resources are very broad, others very specific. Some help you learn big concepts and ideas, others very specific use of a tool. Identifying where you are in a project can help you look for the most useful resource.

**Idea and Exploration**

Thinking up a data analysis project: what kind of question you might want to answer or explore, looking for what data is out there, thinking about what tools you have access to use. In this phase you want broad resources that will introduce you to what’s possible and exciting.

**Scoping and Planning**

Come up with a good question or problem statement. You want to make sure it's doable. Do you have the data? Do you already know the tool fairly well? How much time do you have? In this phase you want to narrow down what you can do from what you want to do; resources should help you set an obtainable goal. May require some exploratory analysis.

**Implementation and Troubleshooting**
Actually doing the data analysis: could include exploratory and/or explanatory analysis, developing and running models. In this phase you are executing your ideas and dealing with challenges as they arise. Good resources will allow you to quickly learn how to use a tool and easily find solutions to specific technical questions and problems.

**Presentation, Reporting, and Evaluation**
Presenting your findings and results, possibly your methodology. In this phase you want resources to help with formatting, or maybe places to talk about what you did and get feedback on how to share it with others.
