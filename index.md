title: How to Python
---
This is a tool that aims to help data people learn Python. Anyone can start at the beginning and take a class or learn basics about how Python works, but some data people may prefer to learn more about what Python can do with data both to show them why they might want to learn Python but also to show that what they already know about data analysis can help them start somewhere that's not the beginning.

People who work with data already have some knowledge and skills that can help them learn programming tools using shortcuts. This tool helps you identify what you already know that can help you, what you need to learn, and how to find resources to go learn it.

The tool is structured to walk you through a series of steps that come together to create a plan to get from where you are to where you want to be:

0. What do you already know?
1. What kind of data do you have?
2. What task do you want to do?
3. What phase of the data analysis are you in?
4. Create a plan

The [Basics](/basics) page describes some beginner information for learning programming. Here you can get a better idea of what it takes to become proficient in Python and learn about all the cool things it can do.
