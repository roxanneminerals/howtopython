  "body": "# About this Project\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nNon-programmers interested in learning programming as a tool to help them work with data need a way to identify appropriate learning resources because there’s so much out there it can be daunting.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nMy solution is an interactive tool like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book that uses information on why a learner wants to learn Python for data analysis and what specific task they want to work on to recommend ways to search for resources. It will also direct the learner to some actual resources for learning Python.\r\n\r\n**Why This Tool?**\r\nhave been a research analyst for about five years, and actively trying to learn Python (and R) for data analysis for about two years. I've found it extremely challenging and I've met many others with similar experiences. Some of the challenges I have identified:\r\n\r\n* Not knowing where to start or what the big picture looks like; no clear view of what's possible or a map of how to get there\r\n* The vast number of resources is daunting; it is difficult to find resources that are both at my skill level and relevant to what I want to learn\r\n* Not knowing what I don't know, lacking the awareness that I don't understand a core concept, and not being able to articulate questions or search terms\r\n* Many resources are intended for people who are or want to become developers or professional programmers, which isn’t me\r\n* I don’t feel like I fit anywhere- other researchers may not know about programming, people who regularly work with data in Python sometimes Excel-shame me, and programmers tell me that learning Python is easy!\r\n",
