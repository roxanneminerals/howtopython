title: About
---
I created this project as a poster for PyCon 2016. My original vision was more like a Choose Your Own Adventure", but that turned into what looked like a flowchart with several steps. The response to my project at PyCon was overwhelmingly positive, so I decided to put it in a format that other people could easily contribute to or fork and use for themselves.

**Problem**
Non-programmers interested in learning programming as a tool to help them work with data need a way to identify appropriate learning resources because there’s so much out there it can be daunting.

**Solution**
My solution is an interactive tool like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book that uses information on why a learner wants to learn Python for data analysis and what specific task they want to work on to recommend ways to search for resources. It will also direct the learner to some actual resources for learning Python.

**Why This Tool?**
have been a research analyst for about five years, and actively trying to learn Python (and R) for data analysis for about two years. I've found it extremely challenging and I've met many others with similar experiences. Some of the challenges I have identified:

* Not knowing where to start or what the big picture looks like; no clear view of what's possible or a map of how to get there
* The vast number of resources is daunting; it is difficult to find resources that are both at my skill level and relevant to what I want to learn
* Not knowing what I don't know, lacking the awareness that I don't understand a core concept, and not being able to articulate questions or search terms
* Many resources are intended for people who are or want to become developers or professional programmers, which isn’t me
* I don’t feel like I fit anywhere- other researchers may not know about programming, people who regularly work with data in Python sometimes Excel-shame me, and programmers tell me that learning Python is easy!

The tool aims to help people to create a mental map of the landscape that is learning Python for data analysis, so that they can navigate it more easily to get from where they are now to where they want to be. It also aims to identify places they might get stuck and help them search for the right resources to get through it.

This website is the second prototype of the tool I'm building, and I'm hoping to get feedback to inform another iteration. Stay tuned!
