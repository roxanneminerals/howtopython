What tools do you currently use to work with data?

People who work with data have an advantage when learning programming. Proficiency or  familiarity with other data tools can provide a conceptual foundation you can build on instead of starting at the very beginning.

* Excel/Spreadsheets: Using formulas in Excel can be similar to programming. You can even create named functions in Excel if you wanted to. Using Pivot tables and other features can help you identify analyses you may want to try in Python. You may even identify tasks that are difficult to do in Excel that may inspire you to try Python!
* Databases and queries (SQL): Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language, but is in a different programming paradigm so the style is different, which might be confusing. It may be useful to read up on how the languages are structured differently
Web-based tool with a graphic Interface (Tableau): Drag-and-drop menus can be a great way to identify the steps and order of an analysis. Once you can visualize what exactly you want to do with your data, you can translate that into Python to see how it could work.
* Math/statistical software (SAS, SPSS, STATA, MATLAB): If you use a domain-specific programming language, you may be able to take an analysis you’ve already done (or look at someone else’s) in the language you know and try it using Python to see how it could work.
GIS and online mapping tools (MapBox, CartoDB): Similar to the drag-and-drop menu idea, spatial analysis software allows you to visualize what you want to do with your data. Desktop GIS allows you to add Python to automate tasks. Additionally, GIS software builds a database to store geospatial data.
* Other Programming language: If you already know another programming language, this tool may not be that useful to you! You are welcome to use it anyway :)
