title: 2. What task do you want to do?
---
There are several tasks you may want to do with your data, and this may impact what kinds of tools you want to learn about using the resources you find.

**Gather, Obtain, Collect, Scrape it**

Learn about:

* Find existing data in a usable format, open data
* File formats, accessibility, machine readability
* Identify potential issues with readability and format.
* Collecting your own data and storing it in a usable format: data collection methods (survey) and coding (efficiency), survey design
* Data structures

**Scraping data from websites: Regular Expressions**

Useful Tools:

* Libraries: csv, and csvkit, pandas, NumPy, Beautiful Soup (HTML/XML)
* Collecting, storing, using data: Data Maturity Framework: University of Chicago Center for Data Science & Public Policy
Munge, Clean, Wrangle, Prepare, Format it

Learn about:
* Data hygiene/cleanliness. What potential problems exist? Why are they problems? How do you deal with them?
* Formatting/re-formatting data. Why would you want to? What are the benefits of one format over another? Using a tool like Tableau requires that your data be formatted a certain way. You could use Python to format it. Many people use Python to prep their data for analysis in another language or with another tool

Useful tools:

* Libraries: pandas, csvkit
* Concept/skill: Regular Expressions

**Analyze, Explore, Look for Patterns, Play with it**

Learn about:

* Types of analysis. Statistical, summarizing, grouping, calculating new fields
* Exploratory vs. explanatory analysis
* Modeling: predictive models and machine learning

Useful tools:

* Libraries: pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib (plotting), csvkit (work with csv files), Seaborn (statistical visualization), pprint (pretty print), scikit-Learn (machine learning)
* If you use pivot tables in Excel, try groupby in pandas
* Kaggle competition: shows a specific data analysis and predictive modeling in Python, R, and Excel

**Visualize it with  Charts, Graphs, or Maps**

Learn about:

* What types of charts are good for the data you have and story you want to tell?
* What data structures are best for what you have and what you want to do?

Useful tools:

* Python libraries: pandas data frame, plotting with matplotlib, Seaborn (statistics), Bokeh (interactive visualization on the web)
* Mapping: GIS (ArcGIS, open source QGIS)
* Choosing a data visualization to present findings: Flowing Data, Storytelling with Data
