title: Basics
---
There are a few things you will have to learn to start working with data using Python:

* Conceptual challenge: if you are used to opening a spreadsheet to view your data, accessing it with Python may seem unintuitive.
* Downloading and installing Python. Version 2 or 3? Anaconda distribution?
* Opening and running Python, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), Jupyter Notebooks 
* Navigating file systems, paths, and the command line
* Basic syntax plus built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, arrays
* Reading in data from a file, writing to a file
* How to identify, obtain, load libraries that are good for the data task you want
* General library use: how do they work? (dot notation)
